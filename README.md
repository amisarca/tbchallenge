## Talent Buddy Mentor Challenge

This simple web application contains two pages, one is a form to register, while the other one is a for to log in. There is no server side scripting, everything being done on the client side.

Routing is done using [Director](https://github.com/flatiron/director), while the templates are handled through [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/). The stylesheet is structured using the [Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework.

In order to run the app, you must install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/), and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/). In order to install the dependencies, you have to execute the following command:
```
npm install
```
To start the server execute:
```
node server.js
```
The application can be accessed on the port 8080 on your localhost. If the port 8080 is you will be able to access it at [127.0.0.1/login](http://127.0.0.1/login), otherwise you can access it at [127.0.0.1:8080/login](http://127.0.0.1:8080/login). An online demo can be found [here](http://tbchallenge.herokuapp.com/login)

All the commands must be run in the root folder of the application.
